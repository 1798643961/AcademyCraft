## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of AcademyCraft!

AcademyCraft is a Minecraft mod about superability, including its aquiring, upgrading and using. The inspiration of the mod comes from [A Certain Scientific Railgun (とある科学の超電磁砲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun) but the mod content is not limited of the background.

## Installation

visit our [Website](http://ac.li-dev.cn/) to get the latest release.

## Dev Setup

Current Forge version: 1.7.10-10.13.4.1448.

Current IC2 version: [2.2.717](http://jenkins.ic2.player.to/job/IC2_experimental/717/).

Current Redstone Flux API version: [1.7.10R1.0.2](https://github.com/CoFH/RedstoneFlux-API).
Current CoFHCore version: [3.0.3-303](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/69162-cofhcore/files/2246919).
Current Thermal Foundation version: [1.2.0-102](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/222880-thermal-foundation/files/2246921).
Current Thermal Expasion version: [4.0.3B1-218](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/69163-thermalexpansion/files/2246924).

The mod requires Java 8 to compile and execute. Officially we use [RetroLamba](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda) to compile the mod, and any use of stream API is seriously forbiddened.

Currently AcademyCraft is under heavy developement, so it is almost always up to date with its dependency mods([LIUtils][liu] and [AnnotationRegistry][ar]).

You must add the two mods mentioned above into your workspace and then add AcademyCraft.
