## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of AcademyCraft!

AcademyCraft is a Minecraft mod about superability, including its aquiring, upgrading and using. The inspiration of the mod comes from [A Certain Scientific Railgun (とある科学の超電磁砲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun) but is not limited of the background.

AcademyCraft is licensed under the [GPL license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html "gpl license")


## Installation

visit our [Website](http://ac.li-dev.cn/) to get the latest release.


## Dev Setup

Current Forge version: 1.7.10-10.13.4.1448.

The mod requires Java 8 to compile and execute. Officially we use [RetroLamba](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda) to compile the mod, and any use of stream API is seriously forbiddened.

Currently AcademyCraft is under heavy developement, so it is almost always up to date with its dependency mods([LIUtils][liu] and [AnnotationRegistry][ar]).

You must add the two mods mentioned above into your workspace and then add AcademyCraft.

## Documents
We are working on filling up the documents of AC codes. You can check out the Chinese version of API document at [HERE](https://github.com/LambdaInnovation/AcademyCraft/tree/master/docs_cn "Chinese Documents"). Pull requests are welcomed.
