Wind Generator is a multi structure block, consisting of base, pillar, main and fan parts, and can convert the kinematic energy of the wind into Imag Flux.

You should construct a wind generator by putting the base, putting 8~40 pillars, and putting the main part on top of the pillar. Now put the fan 
in the main part. If the generator structure is correct, it will now start generating energy.
