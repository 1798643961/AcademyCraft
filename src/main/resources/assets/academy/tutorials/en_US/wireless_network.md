In the world of AcademyCraft, no conductors are needed to transform energy. Instead, use **Wireless Energy System** to transform 
energy between machines easily.

## Node connection

Any __Wireless Node__ constructs an independent energy network. It will automatically balance the energy between all the generators 
and receivers connected to it. Normally, you can connect any machine to a node by opening its connect UI.

Note that a node's transmit range is limited. You can't connect to a node if you are out of range.

## Wireless Energy Network

__Wireless Matrix__ connects nodes in a large range, constructs an even bigger energy network. You can connect to a matrix in 
a node's control panel. Note that you have to initialize a matrix first by giving it SSID and password.

## Frequency Transmitter

The __Frequency Transmitter App__ allows you to establish wireless connection of multiple blocks without opening any UI. Install 
it and try it out!
