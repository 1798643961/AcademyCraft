# Toast&Cat

You can obtain a Toast&Cat only in Creative Mode.

According to Morph's law, if you drop a toast with butter on one side, the butter side is destined to touch the ground; However, if you throw a cat into a air, it will 
always land with its feet. If you combine a toast on a cat's back... A perfect 'perpetual motion machine' is obtained. 

Right clicking a Toast&Cat links it to a random Wireless Node that is close to it.
