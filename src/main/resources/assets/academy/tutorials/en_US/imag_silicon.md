Imag Silicon is a special semiconductor for Imag Flux. Like what silicon is in electric worlds, Imag
Silicon is frequently used for crafting chips.

# Imag Silicon Ore

Imag Silicon Ore can be found in both low and high grounds and appear in small veins. You can only use 
iron or better pickaxe to harvest them. Smelting the ore or processing in Metal Former yields Imag Silicon.

# Imag Silicon

As raw material, they are further processed (either by crafting or metal former) into silicon wafers. 
They are more pure and can be used to craft chips.
