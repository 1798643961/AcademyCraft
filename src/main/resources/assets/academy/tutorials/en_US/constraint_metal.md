Constraint metal, like copper, can be used to conduct energy. However, it also has the ability to 'constraint' ImagFlux energies. Thus it is widely used in wireless 
machines.

Constraint metal can be found in both low and high grounds, and appears in small veins. You have to use stone pickaxe or up to harvest the ore. It can then be smelted 
into constraint metal bars.

Constraint metal bars are usually processed into metal plates for further usages.
