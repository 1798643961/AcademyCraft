Wireless Matrix

![brief]
Matrix is core of a large wireless network.

![content]

Matrix connects multiple Wireless Node to construct a large energy network, and exchange energy between the nodes.

The parameters of matrix (transmit distance, IF per tick, max loads) are determined by two factors:

* The amount of constraint metal plates placed in matrix
* The level of matrix core

When there are no plates placed or no matrix core is placed, you won't be available to use the matrix.
